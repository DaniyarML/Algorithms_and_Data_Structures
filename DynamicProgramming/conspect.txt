Dynamic programming:
1) Combinatorics: How many? (how many ways to make a change)
2) Optimization: Maximize or minimize: (what is the minimum steps to get from A to B)

Memoization - cashed results of the computation, and use it later

1) Define objective functions
2) Identify base cases (starting point)
3) Write down recurrence relation
4) Order of computation
5) Location of the answer
